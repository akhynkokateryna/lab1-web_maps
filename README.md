# Creation of web maps
The file takes four arguments: year when the film was produced, latitude, longitude, and path to database with films.
Then is created a web map with 8 marks with filming locations that were the closest to given location.

Example:

`>>> python main.py 2014 49.83826 24.02324 locator1.list`
